# Ros-Eval
Some demos and tests for programming in ROS.

Originally cloned from [CSE481](https://github.com/cse481wi18/cse481wi18/wiki), a repo for the starter code and samples for CSE 481C at the University of Washington, Winter 2018. The CSE481 repo provides a fully functioning system, this one is missing several neccessary parts we already have installed in other places on our local system.
